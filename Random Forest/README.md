### Random Forest

Replicate figure 15.3 comparing random forests and gradient boosted trees. You can use whatever package you wish, you don't have to use xgboost if you'd rather keep everything in sci-kit learn. Compare the feature importance found by random forests and gradient boosted trees. 

Select another dataset and repeat the analysis. Pick a dataset we have not yet studied in class.
