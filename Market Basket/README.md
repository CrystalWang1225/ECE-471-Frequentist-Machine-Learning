### Market Basket

Select a dataset of interest to you and perform a market basket analysis, including finding frequent itemsets and mining association rules. Do not use a shopping cart dataset - select(or create) another kind of dataset and think of how to frame it as a market basket problem. You can use whatever implemtation of the A Priori algorithm you want, from the book, from here: http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/apriori/, or anything else you find.

This assignment is a little more subjective than previous assignments. Before starting, discuss your dataset with me. You will be graded on the quality of your explanation as well as the code. There are no performance goals to meet as this is a data mining project, but the model does need to be carefuly tuned to select frequent itemsets and association rules with high support, confidence and lift.  Your write-up should discuss what dataset you chose and why, what parameters you selected and why, give examples of itemsets and rules. You should wrap it up with a conclusion about what you 'discovered' about this dataset using this method.
